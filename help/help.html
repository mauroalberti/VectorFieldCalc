	<h2>VectorFieldCalc v. 1.5.1</h2>
	<p>
		This plugin for Quantum GIS allows to calculate physical parameters (e.g., divergence, curl module, pathlines), given a 2D, steady vector field,
		such as the velocity field of glacial flows.
	</p>

	<div>
		In details, the calculated parameters are summarized below:
		<br /><br />
		<table>
		<tr>
		<th>Vector parameters</th>
		<th>Magnitude gradients</th>
		<th>Pathlines</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>magnitude</td>
		<td>along x axis</td>
		<td>pathlines from given start points</td>

	</div>

	<p>
		Divergence and curl are two vector operators widely used in physics and engineering,
		for example, for the study of water flows.
<br />
<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
	The vector field is defined in two input rasters, storing the x-axis and y-axis components of the field.
	These two rasters must have the same geographical extent and resolution.
	In addition, the two raster should have no axis rotations, as well as the same cell resolution in x- and y-directions:
	these are requisites respected by the great majority of raster files.
</p>

<br />
<h2>Derived parameters</h2>

<h4>Magnitude</h4>

<p>
The vector magnitudes for each cell of the input rasters.
</p>

<h4>Orientations</h4>

<p>
The orientations of the vectors are calculated as decimal degrees (0-360&deg;) from the map top, in a clockwise sense.
</p>

	<h4>Divergence</h4>

	<p>
		The divergence is a scalar value derived from the scalar product of nabla and the vector field in the
		neighborhood of a point (<i>x, y, z</i>):
	</p>

	<p>
		The divergence indicates the tendency of a flow to diverge (positive values) or converge (negative) at each individual cell.
	</p>

	<h4>Curl magnitude</h4>

	<p>
		The curl is in general represented by a vector field. Since the input vector field is 2D, the resulting  field has
		the resulting vectors constantly vertical, such that it can be represented by a scalar field with values equal to the curl module,
		positive for anticlockwise rotations, negative for clockwise ones.
	</p>

	<p>
		With GIS data, we usually consider 2D dimensionality. Therefore, we only consider partial
		derivatives with respect to <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes. For the curl, we will have a vertical vector (parallel to <i>k</i>),
		whose magnitude is equal to the last component of the curl formula.
	</p>

	<p>
		Positive values indicate anti-clockwise rotations, negative values clockwise rotations.
	</p>

	<h4>Magnitude gradients</h4>

	<p>
		The variations of the vector magnitudes can be calculated along two fixed orientations, i.e. the x- and y- axis directions,
		as well as along the local orientations of the vector field.
		Positive gradients indicate increase of the vector field magnitude in the analyzed direction, negative gradients the opposite.
	</p>

	<p>
		To determine the magnitude gradients along flow directions, we use a modified version of the equation
		for a DEM directional slope (Neteler & Mitasova, 2008, eq. A.27):
		<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>velocity change per unit length = (dz/dx) * sin(alpha) + (dz/dy) * cos(alpha)</i>
		<br />where <i>alpha</i> is the local orientation of the flow line.
	</p>

	<h4>Pathlines</h4>

	<p>
		The pathlines are calculated for a steady vector field, i.e., a field whose components do not vary with time.
	</p>

	<p>
		The pathlines are calculated using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlenberg 45 method (RKF 45),
		that allows to estimate the error associated with each step interpolation. The step size is adaptive,
		i.e. it is changed automatically from the program to accommodate interpolation errors not larger than
		the provided maximum step error. Values of the vector field are interpolated using a bilinear interpolation,
		for both lothe x and the y components.
	</p>

	<div>
		Input parameters are:
		<ul>
			<li><em>name of shapefile</em> storing start points for pathline calculation</li>
			<li><em>time step</em>: initial value of the individual time steps used for interpolating the path: <i>positive</i> if you want to calculate forward pathlines, <i>negative</i> for backward pathlines.
			It can be changed by the program to accommodate the maximum error for step.</li>
			<li><em>total time</em>: the cumulated time for which a single pathline will be calculated: <i>positive</i> if you want to calculate forward pathlines, <i>negative</i> for backward pathlines. Time step and total time must have the same sign.</li>
			<li><em>max error</em>: the maximum error  allowed for each single step. Its estimation is given by the RKF 45 method.</li>
			<li><em>name of the shapefile</em> storing the interpolated pathlines.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
	The output consists in a point shapefile with the following attribute fields:
	<ul>
		<li><em>path_id</em>: pathline counter, with increasing integer values for each input point</li>
		<li><em>point_id</em>: progressive counter for each interpolated point within a pathline</li>
		<li><em>x</em>: x value for interpolated point</li>
		<li><em>y</em>: y value for interpolated point</li>
		<li><em>estim_err</em>: error (in spatial unit) for interpolated point</li>
		<li><em>delta_s</em>: segment length associated with interpolated point</li>
		<li><em>tot_s</em>: cumulated length for pathline</li>
		<li><em>delta_t</em>: time step for interpolated point: <i>positive</i> for forward pathlines, <i>negative</i> for backward p.</li>
		<li><em>tot_t</em>: cumulated time for pathline: <i>positive</i> for forward pathlines, <i>negative</i> for backward p.</li>
		<li><em>vx</em>: x component of the velocity vector for interpolated point</li>
		<li><em>vy</em>: y component of the velocity vector for interpolated point</li>
		<li><em>inst_v</em>: magnitude of the velocity vector for interpolated point</li>
		<li><em>aver_v</em>: average magnitude of the velocity vector (from start to current location)</li>
	</ul>
